# World Happiness Report Analysis - 2016

## Project Description:
This project involves the analysis of data from the **World Happiness Report** for the year 2016. It includes information about happiness levels in various countries, considering factors such as GDP per capita, social support, life expectancy, freedom, generosity, and corruption levels.

## Objective:
The project's main goal was to investigate which countries are the happiest and which factors impact happiness levels most. Additionally, the project aimed to visualize the data to understand the relationships between different indicators better.

## Tools Used:
- **Python**: As the primary programming language for data analysis.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and processing.
- **Plotly**: For creating interactive visualizations.
- **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib**: For creating static charts.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
- **Meta Llama**: For code generation.

## Key Insights:

### 1. Scandinavian countries are the happiest
- **Denmark**, **Switzerland**, **Iceland**, **Norway**, and **Finland** occupy the top spots in the happiness ranking. These countries are characterized by high GDP per capita, strong social support, and high life expectancy.

### 2. GDP per capita has a strong influence on happiness levels
- The analysis revealed that countries with higher GDP per capita tend to have higher happiness levels. This indicator is one of the most important factors influencing overall happiness.

### 3. Generosity and corruption levels have a lesser impact
- Although generosity and low corruption levels are important, their impact on overall happiness is significantly smaller than GDP per capita or life expectancy.

### 4. Sub-Saharan Africa leads in happiness levels
- When dividing all countries into regions, it turns out that **Sub-Saharan Africa** has the highest level of happiness.
